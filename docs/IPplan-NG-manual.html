Currently the <a class="link" href="http://httpd.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache</a> and <a class="link" href="https://www.lighttpd.net/" target="_blank">lighttpd</a> web servers are preferred, but PHP as an ISAPI or CGI module on IIS works too - follow the appropriate installation instructions in the IPplan-NG directory (INSTALL-IIS+MSSQL). Apache works just fine on Windows platforms too. For installing Apache on a Windows platform, follow <a class="link" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/platform/windows.html" target="_blank">these</a> instructions. Or you can use <a class="link" href="http://www.appservnetwork.com/" target="_blank">AppServ</a> or <a class="link" href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/index.php" target="_blank">WampServer</a> which are complete installation packages for Apache, MySQL and PHP for Windows - just add IPplan-NG by following the installation instructions in the IPPLAN-WINDOWS file (part of IPPlan-NG).</p><section class="sect2" id="idm100"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Databases</h3></div></div></div><p>IPplan-NG requires a working database installation.

In this mode, you will not be concerned at all with individual IP address records and how the customer breaks down his assigned address space. When you operate as an ISP, you may also generate SWIP/registrar entries, which are only useful if you deal directly with ARIN or any other registrar. (SWIP is enabled in the config.php file, see ARIN <a class="link" href="https://www.arin.net/resources/registry/reassignments/#swip" target="_blank">Reporting Reassignments</a> for more details). All the relevant SWIP/registrar information is entered when the customer is created.</p><p>When using this mode, I suggest creating a dummy customer which holds all the allocated address space from your regional registrar (ARIN?) already broken up into the various blocks that you will eventually assign to your customers. All these blocks should be called "free" to allow them to be found using the "Find free" menu option. Once you are ready to assign a block, create a new customer with all the relevant SWIP/registrar information completed, go to your dummy customer and move a block of address space to the newly created customer, and finally generate a SWIP/registrar entry for the new block. In this mode areas and ranges are not too relevant except for the dummy customer (see concepts below). You may also need to create a template for your registrar in the templates directory. If you have done this, feel free to contribute it to IPplan.</p></section></section><section class="sect1" id="idm211"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">Concepts</h2></div></div></div><p>The flow of address management is based on the creation of areas, then ranges which belong to areas, and finally, subnets which belong to ranges. Actually, only subnets are required, but on large networks it makes logical sense to group the network into areas to ease administration and to reduce routing updates on the network. There is a jpeg drawing included with the distribution that graphically shows these relationships. The methodology employed borrows significantly from OSPF routing concepts which are explained more fully <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><section class="sect2" id="idm215"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Deployment strategy</h3></div></div></div><p>So in a new installation, first create the areas, then create ranges adding them to areas, and finally create subnets. Searching is now a simple matter of selecting an area which will display all the ranges for the area, or selecting no area and simply selecting a range from the total list of ranges, or simply selecting a base network address.</p><p>To handle challenges like NAT or other overlapping address space, you will be required to create multiple autonomous systems. See 'Searching' below how to see information across multiple autonomous systems.</p></section><section class="sect2" id="idm219"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Linking addresses</h3></div></div></div><p>IP address records can be linked together. This allows one address or multiple addresses to reference another address or addresses. Using this feature allows for the referencing of NATed addresses or having a link to a loopback address of a device. Linking is done on the IP address details page by completing the "Linked address" field. Once the field is completed, you can follow the link. The link also appears on subnet summary pages.</p><p>You can also link many addresses in one go by choosing multiple addresses in the "Select multiple addresses to do a bulk change" window, then completing the "User" field as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">LNKx.x.x.x userinfo</pre><p>The LNK identifier must be in uppercase, followed by exactly one valid IP address with no spaces, then followed by an optional space and user description. After the page is submitted, the embedded LNK will vanish.</p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If the destination record of a linked address does not exist, a record will automatically get created pointing back to the source address, but only if the destination subnet exists. This is to signal the "Find Next Free" address logic of the subnet that the destination address is used.</p></div></section></section><section class="sect1" id="idm227"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">Administration</h2></div></div></div><p>The access control is divided up into three layers and revolves around the creation of groups:</p><section class="sect2" id="idm230"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Admin user</h3></div></div></div><p>Firstly you will need to create users and groups using the admin user defined in the config.php script. The admin user can only be used on the admin pages. Once you are done with the admin functions, you will be required to re-authenticate as one of the newly created users as soon as you access functions on the main index page.</p></section><section class="sect2" id="idm233"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Customer access</h3></div></div></div><p>When a customer is created, a group must be assigned to the customer. This will be the customers admin group and all members of this group can create and delete both subnets, ranges, areas and individual IP address records for the customer.</p><p>When the subnet is created, the creator will choose a subnet admin group.</p></section><section class="sect2" id="idm237"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Subnet access</h3></div></div></div><p>The users assigned to the group that has subnet access can only modify individual IP records for that subnet.</p><p>Initially I would create three groups, one group that can create customers, one group that can create subnets, areas and ranges, and another group which can only modify individual IP records. Normally in large networks the people that modify IP records are not the same people that administer routers and configure the IP address space.</p><p>If a group is set to see only a particular customer, the same group needs to be used for all operations for the customer. The side effect to this is that the users assigned to the group have full access to the customer and can make any changes to the customers data, including creating and deletion of subnets. This is not ideal and will be changed in future.</p><div class="tip"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>Groups can be created that prevent certain users from changing an administrator defined number of reserved addresses at the start of a subnet.</p></div></section><section class="sect2" id="idm244"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Group authority boundaries</h3></div></div></div><p>Areas of responsibility can be assigned to a group, thus limiting what address space a group can create networks in.

Zone domains are forward zones - there can be as many forward zones as you like per customer. Each of these can be unique or they can even overlap with other customers.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Forward Zones:</em></span> </p><p>To create a forward zone, select a customer and select "Add a DNS zone". The next screen will allow you to enter information for the new zone. The domain name must be entered as must at least two nameservers.</p><p>At this point you have the option of creating a new zone from scratch, cloning (copying) a zone from an already existing zone called "template.com", or importing an existing zone via a zone transfer. If you do a zone transfer, the PRIMARY or SECONDARY DNS servers must be directly contactable from the webserver on which IPplan-NG is running. If the DNS server is not contactable an error will be returned.</p><p>If a domain is created from scratch, the domain name must be entered as must at least two upstream DNS servers. The DNS servers are automatically entered for you if the customer record (created via "Create a new customer/autonomous system") contains DNS servers. This is a good way to not have to manually add the DNS servers for each new zone created. The DNS servers can be changed and will be independent per zone created. At the bottom of the Add/Edit screen is place to enter two zone file paths. In future this can be used to determine where the zone must be saved or on what DNS server the zone must be created - currently these fields do nothing.</p><p>The next step is to add individual records to the newly created zone. Do this under the "Zone DNS records" main menu function. Select the customer, select the domain and add a host. The "Host name" refers to the left hand side of a bind zone file, then the type (A, CNAME or MX - more types in future) and the "IP/Hostname" refers to the right hand side of the zone file. In future the screen will change depending on the record type you select and more record types will be possible. The sort order determines the placement of the record in the zone and on the screen. This is a number and the default is 9999 or the end of the file. If you want to insert records between other records, work out a numbering plan.</p><p>In future this will be automatic with options to "Insert before" and "Insert after". Currently you can renumber the values retaining the order of the entries.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Reverse zones:</em></span> </p><p>To create reverse zones is very much like creating a forward zone, except that there are no detail records. All that is required is to create a starting address and mask. The actual reverse records are extracted based on the start and mask from the IP records when you create a subnet and add records to the subnet. The field used is the host name field and all invalid information in this field will be ignored with a warning.</p><p>Once your forward and reverse zones are created, each time a change is made you will be required to export the zone by clicking on the "Export zone" option. The output generated is in XML and must then be parsed using and XSLT processor into a format compatible with your DNS server.</p><section class="sect2" id="idm271"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Handling exported zones</h3></div></div></div><p>The zone files are created in the directory specified by the DNSEXPORTPATH variable in the config.php file. The files are in XML format and are created when a user hits the Export option either on the DNS page or Reverse zone page. The files have a format of zone_ or revzone_ followed by the zone name followed by a trailing unique identifier, which is operating system dependent. The file has a .xml extension.</p><p>If a template is attached to the forward zone, the template fields will also appear in the exported XML file with tag names the same as the template field names.</p><p>These files must be processed using a XML stylesheet processor into a format suitable for your DNS server, and then placed into the correct location and activated by your DNS server. This is beyond the scope of IPplan-NG and will require custom scripts for your installation. Contributions are welcome.</p><p>Sample procedure:</p><p>You will require a script for your environment that periodically runs to check for new zone files that have been added to the output directory. You will probably use cron to do this. Once your script finds a file, you can extract the file paths saved in IPplan-NG using a simple grep:</p><p><span class="command"><strong>grep -A 1 '&lt;primary&gt;' /tmp/revzone_FS9mEU|grep -v '&lt;primary&gt;'</strong></span></p><p>This gives me the primary file path. Once you have the destination path, process the file and copy the output by whatever means your environment uses to the target DNS server. I would suggest using scp with a public key on the remote server to prevent having to type in user id's and passwords during the copy process.</p><p>Processing the file:</p><p>A sample XSLT stylesheet can be found in the contrib directory to transform the forward zone XML (files starting with zone_) into a bind8 or higher compatible zone file. I use xsltproc from the libxslt package ( <a class="link" href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/" target="_blank">http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/</a>) which should be installed on most modern linux systems. A different stylesheet (.xsl file) will be required for each DNS server system that you use - I have no intention of writing style sheets for all the various DNS servers out there, but you are more than welcome to send me style sheets for different DNS servers to be included with IPplan.</p><p>A sample command is:</p><p><span class="command"><strong>xsltproc bind9_zone.xsl zone_</strong></span></p><p>For sample XML input of:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;

Before these functions will work, the correct config variables need to be set - these include the REGENABLED, MAINTAINERID, REGISTRY, REGEMAIL etc. Only users belonging to the customer admin group can send these updates. Additional fields can be added to the IPplan-NG display pages if required, and these fields are also available to the registrar templates.</p><p>To generate updates, the required registrar template is selected. IPplan-NG includes a limited number of templates, but these are fully customizable and simple to create and modify - see the section on "Templates" later in the manual. Once the template is selected, the fields from the database are substituted into the template file and the output is displayed on the screen. The user then selects which updates should be sent to the registrar. The selected updates are then sent via email and the date the updates were sent are recorded in the IPplan-NG database.</p></section><section class="sect1" id="idm302"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">Searching</h2></div></div></div><p>Creating a special customer called 'All' allows searching for information across all the available customer/autonomous systems using the 'Display subnet' function. This special customer can contain areas and ranges that limit the scope of searches, just like normal customers. Using this feature allows a user to see the entire network picture in one view.</p><p>When creating new subnets, it is also beneficial to create unused subnets with a a description of either 'free' or 'spare'. These can be searched for at a later stage using the 'Find Free' function.</p><p>It may also be beneficial to give ASE (Autonomous System External, networks not local to yours) a special handle like EXTERNAL so that they can be searched for at a later stage. These networks often appear in routing tables as static routes to third parties (not via the Internet).</p><section class="sect2" id="idm307"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Searching for individual address details</h3></div></div></div><p>Searching can also be done on individual addresses using the 'Match any IP address in subnet' option of the 'Display subnet information' option.

NMAP would be used to obtain the host info of all the addresses that are active on the network. Once this is done, the data can be read into IPplan. The NMAP parameters required by IPplan-NG to generate a valid import file are:</p><p>To speed up the process, you can add -n to not resolve host names. The import process also understands the -O operating system detection parameter. To use -O, you will need to drop the -sP parameter. Using -O increases scanning time significantly.</p><p>As of version 3.93 of nmap, the -sP option also returns the MAC address which will be recorded in the MAC address field of the subnet IP record. MAC addresses only appear if the scan was done using root user - thus the MAC address will not appear if nmap was executed through php and the webserver. You can set the S bit on the nmap binary, but this is not advised due to security concerns.</p></section></section><section class="sect1" id="idm334"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">Templates</h2></div></div></div><p>Various forms of templates are available. These include templates that add additional, custom fields to the IPplan-NG display pages (different templates can be added to the customer, subnet and ip address record pages), and templates that then munipulate the data contained in the IPplan-NG databases to generate output for various registrars. All of these templates are fully administrator customizable with display fields added to customer and subnet pages automatically available in output templates used to generate registrar updates.</p><section class="sect2" id="idm337"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Customer, Subnet, DNS and IP address templates</h3></div></div></div><p>The administrator can define a custom template in IPplan-NG to allow the addition of as many custom fields to the customer, subnet, DNS forward zones and ip address record pages as the administrator wishes. This functionality allows flexibility in the way data is added to the database. Some uses for these templates include tracking asset information or WAN circuit information, the management of DHCP address space, dealing with additional and ever changing registrar requirements.</p><p>As mentioned there are different template files for the customer, subnet, DNS and IP address pages. The template for each of these pages has a different name:</p><p><code class="varname">Customer pages - custtemplate.xml</code></p><p><code class="varname">Subnet pages - basetemplate.xml</code></p><p><code class="varname">DNS forward zones - fwdzonetemplate.xml</code></p><p><code class="varname">IP address pages - iptemplate.xml</code></p><p><code class="varname">IP address pages (network address) - iptemplate-network.xml</code></p><p>A sample template called iptemplate.xml.sample can be found in the /ipplan-ng/templates/display directory.</p><p>If a template called called iptemplate-network.xml exists, then this template will be used for network addresses (the first address of the subnet). This is useful to define subnet wide information like VLAN id's, telco line numbers, router configurations etc. If the iptemplate-network.xml does not exist, then the iptemplate.xml template will be used for network addresses.</p><p>The above templates are generic and act across all customers, and thus all fields are the same for all customers. Unique templates can be created per customer by adding the customer id to the template name. To obtain the customer id (a number), use the Admin/Maintenance function within IPplan. To create a unique IP address template for customer id 25, place a template file called iptemplate-25.xml in the /ipplan-ng/templates/display directory. This template will override the default template for customer 25 only.</p><section class="sect3" id="idm354"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">Format of Customer, Subnet and IP address template files</h4></div></div></div><p>The templates are well formed XML files with a .xml extension and should be stored in the /ipplan=ng/templates/display directory.

See the comments of this function for more details.</p><p>A list of all the IPplan-NG triggers and what information is passed to the user_trigger() function can be found in the TRIGGERS file.</p></section><section class="sect1" id="idm426"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">External command line poller</h2></div></div></div><p>The poller allows you to periodically scan subnets for addresses that are active on the network. This information is then logged in the IPplan-NG database and will appear on the display subnet page. You can find the poller script in the IPplan-NG contrib directory.</p><p>The scans are done using nmap, thus large networks can be scanned rapidly. Subnets that are to be scanned get entered into a plain text file, so maintenance is easy. Polling can be automated by adding the poller to cron.</p><p>Firstly, you will need to create a file containing a list of networks/addresses that you would like to poll. The file is a text file with one address per line in the any format that the nmap command understands (type nmap -h for more info).</p><pre class="programlisting">
    10.10.10.0/24 
    10.10.11.* 
    10.12.12.1
    </pre><p>Once you have created your file you will need to make sure the poller is configured correctly. Edit the poller file and change the path at the top to the correct place where the command line php can be found on your system.</p><p>You can find the location by typing</p><span class="command"><strong>which php</strong></span><p>Next make sure that nmap can be found. Type</p><span class="command"><strong>which nmap</strong></span><p>and either update the NMAP statement in the IPplan-NG config.php file, or uncomment the NMAP define at the top of ipplan-poller.php and update to reflect the correct path to nmap. This define will override whatever is in config.php allowing a different NMAP to be used. You may also leave config.php blank to prevent scanning from within the IPplan-NG web frontend.</p><p>Now run the ipplan-poller.php file with the -d option, or navigate to the admin-&gt;maintenance page. This will dump a list of customers and customer id's. You need to find the id of the customer you want to update:</p><span class="command"><strong>php -q ipplan-poller.php -d</strong></span><pre class="programlisting">
    ID      Description
    2       Test
    46      Test customer
    47      Test customer 2
    </pre><p>Finally run the poller again with the correct command line (assuming you want to update the customer called "Test customer" which has id 46):</p><span class="command"><strong>php -q ipplan-poller.php -c 46 -f nmap.list</strong></span><p>If the configuration is correct and there are no errors, there should be no output - the database is updated silently in the background. Any address that was successfully polled will now have a key in the "Pol" column on the IPplan-NG display pages.</p><pre class="programlisting">
    D polled today 
    W polled within last week 
    M last month 
    Y last year
    </pre><p>You can now add the above line to cron to scan certain subnets periodically.</p><p>The following command line options are available with the poller:</p><pre class="programlisting">

    </pre><p>Using the -hostnames option will query the DNS when polling addresses and update the host name field within IPplan-NG with the DNS name. Note that using this option could significantly increase polling time, especially with incorrectly configured DNS servers. Use the -time option to determine impact of using the -hostnames option.</p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Security: You should use a different user and password to access the database using the command line poller. I suggest creating a user that can only SELECT, UPDATE and INSERT into the ipaddr table, and SELECT from the base and customer tables. See your database administrator or manual for more details.</p></div></section><section class="sect1" id="idm451"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">IP address request system</h2></div></div></div><p>IPplan-NG has a request feature whereby users can request individual IP addresses by completing a form. This form is then submitted into the IPplan-NG database and via email to an administrator or help desk account for processing. When the administrator processes the request, all outstanding requests for a particular customer/AS will appear on the IP address modify screen. The administrator picks the relevant address from the list and all the fields are automatically completed with the request details. The administrator can then change some of the fields details before submitting. When the form is submitted, the request is deleted.</p><p>Up to 100 outstanding requests can be active at one time (this is configurable by changing a variable at the start of the requestip.php script). This is to prevent denial of service on the database as the request page is not authenticated. Excess junk requests can be cleared via an admin only option on the maintenance page.</p><p>Request email addresses are set in the config file. The list of visible customers/AS's that addresses can be requested for are also set via config options. The default is that addresses can be requested for all customers.</p><p>The request page also has the top menu structure disabled by default (this can be enabled by changing a variable at the start of the requestip.php script). Disabling the menu allows the page to be used as a generic request page on a sites intranet server without confusing regular users with menu options they cannot use or access.</p><div class="tip"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>If an email field exists in the iptemplate.xml file, this field will be used to popup an email window, allowing the newly actioned requested address to be emailed back to the requester. The email window will only display after Submit has been pressed and the user has entered a valid email address.</p></div><p>A sample definition for this field is as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;FIELD&gt;
  &lt;DEFINITION NAME="email" DESCRIP="Email address" TYPE="C" MAXLENGTH="100" SIZE="100" ROWS="1" DEFAULT="" REGEX="" ERRMSG="Invalid field: Additional information" /&gt;
&lt;/FIELD&gt;</pre><p>See the section on templates for more information.</p><p>If a valid email address is found in the above field you will be given the option to email the details back to the requester. The gateways are site specific and can vary - manual completion of this field is required unless one of the subnet addresses has a description field starting with GW. This address will then be used as the gateway address in the email.</p></section><section class="sect1" id="idm463"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">Authentication schemes</h2></div></div></div><p>IPplan-NG supports either its own internal authentication scheme, or an external scheme based on the Apache webservers authentication modules. To use an external scheme, change the setting in the config.php file. Next, place the relevant .htaccess file in the IPplan-NG user subdirectory (/ipplan-ng/user). Do not place an equivalent file in the admin subdirectory as the admin account cannot be overridden.</p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>When using the external authentication method, IPplan-NG never prompts for a userid and password. It is the responsibility of the external module to do the prompting, if any. IPplan-NG uses the credentials supplied and matches them to the IPplan-NG userid records to determine if access should be granted.</p></div><div class="important"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>The relevant users requiring access to IPplan-NG must still be created via the IPplan-NG admin interface, but no password information is required as this is overridden by the external authenticator.</p></div><p>If the user is removed from the external authenticators database (LDAP, RADIUS etc), the user will no longer be able to log in to IPplan-NG even if the account still exists in IPplan.
