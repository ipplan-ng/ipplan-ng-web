>In ISP mode, you will assign blocks of IP address space to 
      your customers. In this mode, you will not be concerned at all 
      with individual IP address records and how the customer breaks 
      down his assigned address space. When you operate as an ISP, you 
      may also generate SWIP/registrar entries, which are only useful 
      if you deal directly with ARIN or any other registrar. (SWIP is 
      enabled in the config.php file, see ARIN 
      <A
HREF="http://www.arin.net/minutes/tutorials/swipit.htm"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;      tutorial</A
> for more details). All the relevant 
      SWIP/registrar information is entered when the customer is 
      created.</P
><P
>When using this mode, I suggest creating a dummy customer 
      which holds all the allocated address space from your regional 
      registrar (ARIN?) already broken up into the various blocks that 
      you will eventually assign to your customers. All these blocks 
      should be called "free" to allow them to be found using 
      the "Find free" menu option. Once you are ready to 
      assign a block, create a new customer with all the relevant 
      SWIP/registrar information completed, go to your dummy customer 
      and move a block of address space to the newly created customer, 
      and finally generate a SWIP/registrar entry for the new block. In 
      this mode areas and ranges are not too relevant except for the 
      dummy customer (see concepts below). You may also need to create 
      a template for your registrar in the templates directory. If you 
      have done this, feel free to contribute it to IPplan.</P

>The flow of address management is based on the creation of 
    areas, then ranges which belong to areas, and finally, subnets 
    which belong to ranges. Actually, only subnets are required, but on 
    large networks it makes logical sense to group the network into 
    areas to ease administration and to reduce routing updates on the 
    network. There is a jpeg drawing included with the distribution 
    that graphically shows these relationships. The methodology 
    employed borrows significantly from OSPF routing concepts which are

    interface. Zone domains are forward zones - there can be as many 
    forward zones as you like per customer. Each of these can be unique 
    or they can even overlap with other customers.</P
><P
><EM
>Forward Zones:</EM
></P
><P
>To create a forward zone, select a customer and select 
    "Add a DNS zone". The next screen will allow you to enter 
    information for the new zone. The domain name must be entered as 
    must at least two nameservers.</P
><P
>At this point you have the option of creating a new zone from 
    scratch, cloning (copying) a zone from an already existing zone 
    called "template.com", or importing an existing zone via 
    a zone transfer. If you do a zone transfer, the PRIMARY or 
    SECONDARY DNS servers must be directly contactable from the 
    webserver on which IPplan is running. If the DNS server is not 
    contactable an error will be returned.</P
><P
>If a domain is created from scratch, the domain name must be 
    entered as must at least two upstream DNS servers. The DNS servers 
    are automatically entered for you if the customer record (created 
    via "Create a new customer/autonomous system") contains 
    DNS servers. This is a good way to not have to manually add the DNS 
    servers for each new zone created. The DNS servers can be changed 
    and will be independent per zone created. At the bottom of the 
    Add/Edit screen is place to enter two zone file paths. In future 
    this can be used to determine where the zone must be saved or on 
    what DNS server the zone must be created - currently these fields 
    do nothing.</P
><P
>The next step is to add individual records to the newly 
    created zone. Do this under the "Zone DNS records" main 
    menu function. Select the customer, select the domain and add a 
    host. The "Host name" refers to the left hand side of a 
    bind zone file, then the type (A, CNAME or MX - more types in 
    future) and the "IP/Hostname" refers to the right hand 
    side of the zone file. In future the screen will change depending 
    on the record type you select and more record types will be 
    possible. The sort order determines the placement of the record in 
    the zone and on the screen. This is a number and the default is 
    9999 or the end of the file. If you want to insert records between 
    other records, work out a numbering plan.</P
><P
>In future this will be automatic with options to "Insert 
    before" and "Insert after". Currently you can 
    renumber the values retaining the order of the entries.</P
><P
><EM
>Reverse zones:</EM
></P
><P
>To create reverse zones is very much like creating a forward 
    zone, except that there are no detail records. All that is required 
    is to create a starting address and mask. The actual reverse 
    records are extracted based on the start and mask from the IP 
    records when you create a subnet and add records to the subnet. The 
    field used is the host name field and all invalid information in 
    this field will be ignored with a warning.</P
><P
>Once your forward and reverse zones are created, each time a 
    change is made you will be required to export the zone by clicking 
    on the "Export zone" option. The output generated is in 
    XML and must then be parsed using and XSLT processor into a format 
    compatible with your DNS server.</P

      format of zone_ or revzone_ followed by the zone name followed by 
      a trailing unique identifier, which is operating system 
      dependent. The file has a .xml extension.</P
><P
>If a template is attached to the forward zone, the template 
      fields will also appear in the exported XML file with tag names 
      the same as the template field names.</P

      welcome.</P

><P
>You will require a script for your environment that 
      periodically runs to check for new zone files that have been

      the subnet IP record. MAC addresses only appear if the scan was 
      done using root user - thus the MAC address will not appear if

      subnet, DNS forward zones and ip address record pages as the 
      administrator wishes. This functionality allows flexibility in 
      the way data is added to the database. Some uses for these 
      templates include tracking asset information or WAN circuit 
      information, the management of DHCP address space, dealing with 
      additional and ever changing registrar requirements.</P

><P
>If a template called called iptemplate-network.xml exists, 
      then this template will be used for network addresses (the first 
      address of the subnet). This is useful to define subnet wide 
      information like VLAN id's, telco line numbers, router 
      configurations etc. If the iptemplate-network.xml does not exist, 
      then the iptemplate.xml template will be used for network 
      addresses.</P

>The above templates are generic and act across all 
      customers, and thus all fields are the same for all customers. 
      Unique templates can be created per customer by adding the 
      customer id to the template name. To obtain the customer id (a 
      number), use the Admin/Maintenance function within IPplan. To 
      create a unique IP address template for customer id 25, place a 
      template file called iptemplate-25.xml in the

><P
>IPplan has a request feature whereby users can request 
    individual IP addresses by completing a form. This form is then 
    submitted into the IPplan database and via email to an 
    administrator or help desk account for processing. When the 
    administrator processes the request, all outstanding requests for a 
    particular customer/AS will appear on the IP address modify screen. 
    The administrator picks the relevant address from the list and all 
    the fields are automatically completed with the request details. 
    The administrator can then change some of the fields details before 
    submitting. When the form is submitted, the request is 
    deleted.</P
><P
>Up to 100 outstanding requests can be active at one time 
    (this is configurable by changing a variable at the start of the 
    requestip.php script). This is to prevent denial of service on the 
    database as the request page is not authenticated. Excess junk 
    requests can be cleared via an admin only option on the maintenance 
    page.</P
><P
>Request email addresses are set in the config file. The list 
    of visible customers/AS's that addresses can be requested for 
    are also set via config options. The default is that addresses can 
    be requested for all customers.</P
><P
>The request page also has the top menu structure disabled by 
    default (this can be enabled by changing a variable at the start of 
    the requestip.php script). Disabling the menu allows the page to be 
    used as a generic request page on a sites intranet server without 
    confusing regular users with menu options they cannot use or
