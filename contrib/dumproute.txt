dumproute.sh

A script using net-snmp tools to read a routers routing table and format
the output into something that can be loaded into IPplan via the import
functions. You will need:

GNU awk
GNU cut
net-snmp (tested with version 5.0.6)

Most linux distributions will have these tools loaded. Note that different 
versions of net-snmp use different options and you may need to adjust them.

Usage:

dumproute.sh <ip address of router>
